# Prediction using Decision Tree Algorithm:
&emsp;The task aims to creating a Decision Tree classifier and visualize it graphically. The purpose is if we feed any new data to this classifier, it would be able to
predict the right class accordingly.

## Overview
&emsp;The data set contains 3 classes of 50 instances each, where each class refers to a type of iris plant.  One class is linearly separable from the other 2; the latter are NOT linearly separable from each other. 
- Predicted attribute: class of iris plant.
- Number of Instances: 150 (50 in each of three classes)
- Number of Attributes: 4 numeric, predictive attributes and the class
- Attribute Information:
   1. sepal length in cm
   2. sepal width in cm
   3. petal length in cm
   4. petal width in cm
   5. class: 
      - Iris Setosa
      - Iris Versicolour
      - Iris Virginica

&emsp;I used Scikit-learn, a free software machine learning library for the Python programming language to build a Decision Tree Classifier which will then predict the class of Iris correctly. I also used cost complexity pruning to improve the accuracy of my model.
